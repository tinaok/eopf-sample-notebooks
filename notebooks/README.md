# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to EOPF Sentinel Zarr Samples Notebooks

The Sentinels EOPF Sentinel Zarr Samples project is composed of several components, each implemented and maintained by experts from the tendering consortium. The core component, the EOPF Core Platform, is responsible for delivering EOPF Zarr data products to users. Key features include re-formatting ingested SAFE data into EOPF Zarr data products and providing data access via STAC API and S3 API.

Additional user services are provided through the EOPF User Platform, which hosts applications like JupyterHub, Dask, and a STAC Browser. These technologies support user adoption of the new EOPF Zarr data products by lowering the barrier to cloud applications and data discovery.

The development of Jupyter Notebooks and OSS libraries and plug-ins is crucial for user adoption. Experts from various consortium members will develop these tools to demonstrate the advantages of the new EOPF Zarr data format. The project also involves creating OSS libraries and plug-ins for major programming languages to integrate the new data format with traditional and cloud-native software.

The notebooks will be deployed with GitHub pages, executing them automatically and providing a rendered version.
